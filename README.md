**'Undergraduate Student at WPI and Aspiring Software Engineer'**

:wave: Hi and welcome to my GitHub :wave:!, an undergraduate computer science student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I have a strong passion for building innovative projects that solve real-world problems. On this page, you can follow along my journey to become a software engineer as I learn through hands-on experiences and building projects.

I first got introduced to computer science through the First Lego League back when I was growing up near Boston. Since then, I've expanded my skills by learning new languages and concepts while working on projects like a Discord Music Bot, DSA Visualizer, and more. My goal is to continue acquiring new technical abilities and making things that showcase what I can do.

I learn best by actively working on things, so my website features various hands-on coding projects I've built using my latest skills. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and creator. Feel free to look around!
